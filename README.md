# Segment Play

Segment Play is a tool that shows some possibilities of real-time segmentation in an interactive scenario with a choreographic or game-like context.

## Install

Install pytorch see (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Following version were used in development on Windows 10 & 11:

```
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu117 torchvision==0.15.2+cu117 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

Install other python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




### Models

Segmentation model for MobileSAM can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM) or directly [mobile-sam.pt](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM/blob/master/weights/mobile_sam.pt).

Segmentation models for SAM can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/FastSAM) and is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/LICENSE).

Models used for tracking can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX/tree/main/demo/ONNXRuntime) or directly [YOLOX-Tiny](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX/releases/download/0.1.1rc0/yolox_tiny.onnx)

## Demo

Starting `python src/scenario_director.py` will run a demo using an USB-Camera input. The application will detect and track any person entering the cameras field of view. Various effects can be applied via segmentation of the detected and tracked persons in near real-time. You can choose the active effects by pressing certain keys, the controls are listed in the terminal. Some effects react to different attributes (e.g. position in the room and shape) of a person and allowing a live interaction with the application. The persons interacting, can see the effect immediately on a connected display. I recommend placing the webcam above a large connected display facing the area of interest.

### Hardware

* Webcam

Recommended:

* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or better
* CUDA
* Large display to see the live-image from a distance
